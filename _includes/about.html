                    <h2>About me</h2>
25-years-old, since teen-age I've been playing around math, logic, curiosity, and love for life, with endless enthusiasm. <br/> After living in Italy, UK, Spain and traveling for long periods across Turkey, Tunisia, Syria, India, Morocco (and more), I've found my happy stability in the Netherlands, perfect place where to grow and realize all the ideas and purposes that came on the way. 
<br/>
			I’m enthusiastic about making the most out of the knowledge I've absorbed and starting my career in a challenging environment that reflects my interests and goals.
<br/>I have a strong mathematical background, passion for coding and innate problem-solving attitude. <br/>I believe statistics to be an amazing tool we have to create something with a meaningful, ethical impact.
			<br/>I love to always develop myself in new ways.<br/>
			Self-learning how to code this website was part of it.
