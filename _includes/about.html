Data Science Lab - SIG Machine Learning Applications 
Feb 2018 – Ongoing Utrecht, NL 

The objective of SIG ML:A is to bring machine learning experts and substantive researchers together to answer novel scientific questions in their domain. I worked on the following projects: • MyPersonality:personalityanalysisbasedonFacebookdata; 
WordEmbedding: can a model predict the answer of a specific question?
               I organized meetings to foster collaborations across fields and the application of machine learning to specific domains (Geography, Medicine, etc.).

Project Traineeship 
Next Empire 
Sept 2018 – Nov 2018 

Next Empire (http://nextempire.net) is a digital product studio with many clients in the music business. For my audio segmentation project I’ve built from scratch an audio files classification model which seg- mented radiostreams into the individual songs and the speech or com- mercials in between. I used: 
• the HTML parser BeautifulSoup to retrieve data from remote websites; • librosa to decompose .mp3 files in spectrograms; • Python Keras to build the neural network classification model; • Changepoint Analysis to automate the classification process.
